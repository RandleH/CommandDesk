The command desk is a programmable and useful tool for collecting data, adjusting parameters, showing results, controling devices and more. Command desk theoretically supports all devices with NRF24L01 or BLE but the interface should be rebuilt. 

The target of the command desk is STM32F103 ARM Coretex-M3 MCU. The board has built-in ST-LINK for programming and emulation, USB FS for data stram, LED, JoyStick and OLED 0.96.
